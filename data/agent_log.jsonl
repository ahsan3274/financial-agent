The `data_analyzer_report` tool was successfully used to generate a comprehensive report covering the period from 1900-01-01 to 2024-07-26.  \n\nKey findings from the report include a total spend of $18,832.19, an average transaction value of $98.08, and a breakdown of spending by category (Groceries, Utilities, Rent, Transportation, Entertainment, Other). The report also identified spending trends, such as slightly increasing overall spending, steady grocery costs, increasing utility costs, and decreasing transportation costs.  Specific insights were also provided, such as suggestions to explore options for reducing utility costs and setting a budget for entertainment.\n\nNo issues were encountered during task execution. The final outcome was a successful data analysis with a detailed report providing insights into spending patterns and trends.", "timestamp": 1745690591.879105}
